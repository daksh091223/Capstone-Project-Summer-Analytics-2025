# Capstone-Project-Summer-Analytics-2025
Capstone Project for the Summer Analytics 2025 of Consulting &amp; Analytics Club

 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots
Real-time, data-driven pricing engine for urban parking lots based on demand, traffic, and vehicle factors. Built for the Summer Analytics 2025 capstone project hosted by the Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway.
________________________________________
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Static parking prices lead to inefficiencies like overcrowding or underutilization. This project implements dynamic pricing models for 14 parking lots using real-time data such as:
â€¢	Occupancy levels
â€¢	Queue length
â€¢	Vehicle type
â€¢	Nearby traffic conditions
â€¢	Special days/events
The goal is to maximize utilization and optimize revenue by adjusting prices in real-time.

ðŸ§  Models Implemented
1.	Baseline Linear Model â€“ Price increases proportionally to occupancy
2.	Demand-Based Model â€“ Considers queue, traffic, vehicle weight, special days
3.	(Optional) Competitive Model â€“ Uses location to adjust price based on nearby lots

ðŸ”„ Workflow Explained
1.	Data Ingestion:
o	Load dataset with 73 days of 30-min interval data
o	Combine date & time to single timestamp
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Map categorical features to numeric (traffic, vehicle type)
o	Sort and group by parking lot
3.	Model Application:
o	Model 1: Iteratively compute price based on occupancy
o	Model 2: Calculate demand function using weighted feature contributions
4.	Visualization:
o	Use Bokeh to create interactive time-series plots for each parking lot
o	Compare pricing strategies across time
5.	(Optional) Model 3:
o	Compute distances between lots
o	Adjust price based on competitor load and cost (future scope)
